Exercise 3.24: Redo the last exercise from ยง 3.3.3 (p. 105) using iterators

Exercise 3.20: Read a set of integers into a vector. Print the sum of each pair of
adjacent elements. Change your program so that it prints the sum of the first and last
elements, followed by the sum of the second and second-to-last, and so on
