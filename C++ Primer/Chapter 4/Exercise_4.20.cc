/*
Exercise 4.20: Assuming that iter is a vector<string>::iterator, indicate
which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the behavior of the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.
(a) *iter++; (b) (*iter)++; (c) *iter.empty()
(d) iter->empty(); (e) ++*iter; (f) iter++->empty();
