//While loops are more flexible, can be allowed to run longer or shorter based on a condition
//For example if you wanted something to run while a flag was set to 1, you could have a condition that sets it to 0 to cease the loop
//This however can lead to a never ending loop if not careful with the condition of the while

//For loops are easier to implement when you want something to run a set number of times, which the limit could be set via a variable
//This is less likely to lead to a never ending loop, but still possible if the limits and increment is not correct
