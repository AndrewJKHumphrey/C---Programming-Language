Exercise 6.15: Explain the rationale for the type of each of find_charâ€™s parameters
In particular, why is s a reference to const but occurs is a plain reference? Why are
these parameters references, but the char parameter c is not? What would happen if
we made s a plain reference? What if we made occurs a reference to const?
